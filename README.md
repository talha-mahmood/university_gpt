# University GPT: Personalizing Education with Generative Artificial Intelligence

**Imagine a university that adapts to your individual learning style and pace.** That's the vision behind University GPT, a revolutionary **conversational tool and AI app** that personalizes education for each student.

University GPT is a conversational tool and a Generative AI app which personalizes education for each and every student. Students can access it using two kinds of interfaces: Graphic User Interface (GUI) and Conversational User Interface (Conversational UI).

The GUI will be built by using the OpenAI Assistant APIs and Conversational UI by using OpenAI GPTs. Both will be interacting with our University APIs. We will build both but first we will build the University Custom GPT.

## Lets Get Started

The GPT will first build a student profile by asking the student questions and taking quizzes in order to construct the student capability matrix. The matrix will continuesly be updated as the learning process moves forward. The contents of the course the students take will be customized for each student given his or her capability matrix. After a topic's content is presented to the student to learn he/she will immediately be required to take a quiz to judge his/her understanding of the subject matter. The next step in the learning process will be generated given the results of the quiz. The results will also be used to update the capability matrix of the student.  

**Here's how it works:**

* **Get to know you:** University GPT starts by building a **student profile**. Through **conversations and quizzes**, it identifies your strengths, weaknesses, and learning preferences. This creates a dynamic **"capability matrix"** that evolves as you learn.
* **Your personalized study path:** Forget one-size-fits-all lectures. University GPT tailors course content based on your capability matrix. **No more struggling with concepts beyond your grasp or feeling bored with repetitive material.** 
* **Active learning:** After each learning module, you'll take a **quiz** to gauge your understanding. The results **instantly adjust your study path** and update your capability matrix. This **feedback loop** ensures you're always challenged and engaged.
* **Two ways to learn:** Choose the platform that suits you best. University GPT offers a **visual interface** (think intuitive menus and dashboards) or a **conversational interface** (chat with the AI directly!).

**University GPT empowers you to:**

* **Learn at your own pace:** No need to keep up with the pack. Take your time to master concepts and explore your interests.
* **Stay motivated:** Personalized learning keeps you engaged and prevents boredom.
* **Boost your confidence:** See your progress and celebrate your achievements as you master new skills.
* **Become a self-directed learner:** Develop the critical thinking and problem-solving skills needed for lifelong learning.

**University GPT is more than just an app, it's a transformation in education.** It's about putting students at the center of the learning process and unlocking their full potential.

**University GPT is multi-tanent** You will be able to create many and any kind of university with it.

**Think you're ready to experience the future of education? University GPT is waiting for you.**

## Gen AI University: Certified Cloud Applied Generative AI Developer

We will use University GPT go lauch a GenAI University which will start by offering a six month "Certified Cloud Applied Genertative AI Developer Program". To begin with we will be using GenAI to teach GenAI development. 

The complete details of the certification program is as follows:

Certified Cloud Applied Generative AI Engineer (GenEng)

Selected Headline + Subheading Combo:
Headline: Join the Generative AI Era as a Professional
Subheading: Become a Certified Cloud Applied Generative AI Engineer (GenEng) in 6 Months

The duration of the program will be six months. 

Three hours of classes each week:
We will have interactive online classes using Zoom and Google Colaboratory. The classes will be held twice a week for 1.5 hours each. 

One and half hour of lab each week:
We will have an interactive online lab using Zoom and Microsoft Visual Studio Live Share. The lab will be held once a week for one and a half hours. Visual Studio Live Share will allow our students to work together with an instructor, while retaining their personal VS Code editor preferences (e.g. theme, keybindings), as well as having their own cursor. This will allow the students to seamlessly transition between following the lab instructor, and being able to explore ideas/tasks on your own. This ability to work together and independently provides a collaboration experience that feels much like in-person collaboration.

A Six Months Cloud GenAI Crash Program:

Part 1: Prompt Engineering (1 Week)
Part 2: Generative AI Introduction for Everyone (1 Week)
Part 3: Python Programming Crash Course (1 Month)
Part 4: Data Web Apps using Streamlit (1 Week)
Part 5: Using GenAI APIs with Python (1 Month)
Part 6: GenAI Web Projects (1 Week)
Part 7: API-as-a-Product (1 Month)
Part 8: Containerized Development, Testing, and Cloud Deployment (1 Month)
Part 9: Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Automation, and CI/CD Pipelines (2 Weeks)
Part 10: End-to-End Cloud GenAI Projects (2 Weeks)

Study Material:

https://github.com/panaverse/learn-generative-ai

Program Fee: Rs. 15,000 or $49 for the complete six month program.

Student Background: Students of any background can join the certification program. No prior prerequisites are required. Doctor, Engineers, Marketiers, etc. can join.
